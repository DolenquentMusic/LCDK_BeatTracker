By loading and running ClickyMcBatchFace.m (and ensuring the path points 
to the Mixed_datafiles folder or a similar folder containing 
songs as .wav files and associated beat annotations in .txt files),
this script will populate the Mixed_Datafiles folder with with more .wav and 
.txt files corresponding to different mix levels of the song itself and 
a synthesized click track.
