The network runs using python with the numpy, Theano, and Keras libraries. To train the network 
a folder of datafiles is needed and text files for training, validation and testing are required 
to point to the files in that folder designated for each task. If these requirements are met, 
the program should train a network and export the weights and predictions as a .h5 file, and 
export the model and history as an .hdf5 file.
